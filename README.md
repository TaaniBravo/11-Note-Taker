# Unit 11 HW Note Taker
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3-blue)

Create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## User Story
```
AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes
I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
* Application should allow users to create and save notes.
* Application should allow users to view previously saved notes.
* Application should allow users to delete previously saved notes.

This note taker is a great way to save and store mental notes that you will want to revisit later. Feel free to use and make notes as you please.
